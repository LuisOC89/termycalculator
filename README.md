## Calculator in terminal

Calculator created in order to participate in the 2nd edition of the contest [zContest](https://github.com/soft9000/zContest)

### Start application

2. Using [bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or other program of your preference (with python previously installed)
access the project's folder.
3. Enter on bash terminal: `python interface.py` 

### Scope
1. You will be able to enter mathematical expressions like if you were using a calculator.
2. Operations are limited to sum, multiplication, division (and operations inside parenthesis).
3. Decimal numbers will have to be entered in fractional form. Ex: `1/2` instead of `0.5` .
4. It is ok if you leave blank spaces. The program will put your numbers together for you.

### Examples:
`Calculate this: 12+34/2+1+2*5-30`  
`Result: 10.0`  
  
`Calculate this: 1 2 + 4     4`  
`Result: 56`

`Calculate this: (((12+3/(4/5))-32)+5)`  
`Result: -11.25`

`Calculate this: 23+(1)+6+(87)-32/(9*5)`  
`Result: 116.29`
